# MachineLearning
Code and snippets learned over internet that' working

**Knn-classifier**
We applied two methods to tune hyperparameters:

1. An exhaustive Grid Search
1. A Randomized Search

Both of these hyperparameter tuning routines were then applied to the k-NN algorithm and the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.<br>

**Neural Networks**
Currently working simple neural networks written in python for :
1. single layer multi range of hidden nodes
2. Multi Layer customozable nodes.

Both present in <i>neural</i> Folder.
