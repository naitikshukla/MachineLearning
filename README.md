Code and snippets learned over internet that' working

In Knn-classifier
We applied two methods to tune hyperparameters:

    An exhaustive Grid Search
    A Randomized Search

Both of these hyperparameter tuning routines were then applied to the k-NN algorithm and the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
